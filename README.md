# Styleguide Checklist

A brand styleguide aims to establish a central reference document for all touchpoint standards and patterns, with the goal of increasing consistency and improving communication.

This is a checklist of potential things that might want to be considered when constructing a styleguide for a company or project. Currently a work in progress so please feel free to open issues or pull requests.

## Planning your styleguide

A series of key questions to ask yourself in the initial phase of planning out the structure and layout of your styleguide.

### Audience
- Who is the audience?
- What are their biggest needs?
- What needs do they not have, that we are assuming they have?
- How will they use it?

### Onboarding
- What is their process? How can we structure the styleguide in a way that reduces friction and unknowns for a new teammate or person that is collaborating with us?
- New team members (internal) vs freelancers & collaborators (external) – what are the differences (if any) in how they will consume the styleguide and what they require in it?

### Guidance
- Video tutorials – what can we quickly produce to ease understanding in critical or complex points?
- Written guides and visual examples – how do we write the documentation in a way that strikes a balance between too little and too much?

### Inspiration
You can find a comprehensive list of styleguides and design system [over here](https://github.com/alexpate/awesome-design-systems), curated by [@alexpate](https://github.com/alexpate/). Use it to see how other orgs have structured their libraries based on comprehensiveness, organization size, and industry.

### Tools
A series of apps that can be used to construct the styleguide and easily keep it updated. Choose according to your requirements and needs, as each one as different features and integrations.
